********* FIRST USE CONNECTION HINTS ************** 
a.) Connect the GT-100 via a USB cable, 
ensure the Boss usb driver software is installed..

b.) Start the FxFloorBoard program, for the Menu select Preferences/Midi and select the GT100 midi device for midi input and output.

c.) Select the editor program "Connect" button, it should stay "on" if all connections are correct.

d.) Open the Patch-Tree side panel by clicking your mouse pointer on the 'yellow arrow', 
the Patch-Tree has items which will expand when you click on the [+] symbols.
 When the tree items expand, you will see the patch names appear as the editor requests this information from the GT100.

e.) A single mouse pointer click on the Patch-Tree name will change the GT100 to that selected patch only 
- sound played through the GT-100 will have the sound of that patch.
 
f.) A double click on the patch name will load the patch information from the GT100 into the editor, 
all the patch settings will update the editor GUI.

g.) Any knob turning will change the sound of the effect being adjusted, 
when the desired sound is achieved, you can either save the patch to the GT100 or save the patch to file on disk.

h.) To save the patch to the GT-100, select a location with a 'single-click' on the Patch-Tree,
then press the "write/sync" button. 

****************** If there is a problem 'connecting' ensure the GT-100 MIDI UNIT ID is set to "1" (factory default) 
* and the midi channel is set to "1".*************************************************************************

GT100-FxFloorBoard: 
NOTE: THIS IS AN UNPAID PROJECT, SO FAR INVESTING MANY 1000's HOURS OF MY TIME OVER 7 YEARS.
I am not employed by Roland, nor is Roland affiliated with the software.
 
I WILL NOT ACCEPT LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK CORRECTLY. 

files can be saved/loaded as syx or mid (SMF) or gcl (Librarian) formats.
the GT-100FxFloorBoard will eventually be able open GT-10 *.gxg & *.mid files, and translate GT-8 patch files (*.syx single patch type).

layout increased, which may be a problem for low screen resolutions. (i use 1366 X 782 minimum)

This project is a continuing session of evolution.........
